# AI-Search-Algorithms
Current AI systems uses many different data structures and and algorithms.Search Algorithms are one of 
these algoritms that applicable in many areas like self driving cars,games like maze runner and GPS systems extra.
Now I going to impelement the common search algorithms using python with given collections of cities.
Then I will benchmark the algorithms with different number of data to check time complexity.
Algorithms -> Breadth First Search (BFS)
           -> Depth First Search (DFS)
           -> Dijkstra Search
           -> A star Search
